# Dependency Injection Examples

## Overview
This repository contains various examples demonstrating Dependency Injection (DI) concepts in Java. It covers different injection techniques, loose coupling principles, and best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code.

## Directory Structure
The following are the key concepts covered in this repository:

### 1. Constructor Injection
- **Folder:** `Constructor-Through-Injection`
- **Description:** Demonstrates how dependency injection is achieved via constructor-based injection.

### 2. Property Injection
- **Folder:** `Dependency-Injection-Introduction`
- **Description:** Provides an introduction to dependency injection using property injection.

- **Folder:** `Property-Injection`
- **Description:** Shows how property-based dependency injection works.

### 3. Interface Injection
- **Folder:** `Interface-Through-Injection`
- **Description:** Illustrates how dependencies can be injected via an interface.

### 4. Loose Coupling
- **Folder:** `Loose-Coupling`
- **Description:** Covers the concept of loose coupling in object-oriented programming using dependency injection.

### 5. Setter Injection
- **Folder:** `Setter-Method-Through-Injection`
- **Description:** Demonstrates how dependencies can be injected using setter methods.

### 6. Tight Coupling
- **Folder:** `Tight-coupling`
- **Description:** Explains tight coupling and why it should be avoided.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
